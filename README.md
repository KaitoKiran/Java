# Java

TileGame is a project I made 1 1/2 years ago, sadly I never finished it due to motivational and Javaish reasons.  I made it alongside a youtube tutorial. I didn't know what I was doing back then, but I now more or less understand most of it. Maybe I'll pick it up again or start completely new on a platform like Unity.

UNO is a project we did in school as a group, just felt like putting it up here. This is also the Project that has not been graded yet. It's not very clean but it works for the most part.
